error details and stack traces for 500 error responses, and have them linked to
Sentry issues automatically.

### Request logging

Drill down from insights to individual requests or use powerful filtering to
understand how consumers have interacted with your API. Configure exactly what
is included in the logs to meet your requirements.

Get notified immediately if something isn't right using custom alerts, synthetic
uptime checks and heartbeat monitoring. Notifications can be delivered via
email, Slack or Microsoft Teams.
